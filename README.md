Haha if you're keen you may have noticed that this github pages site only has one HTML file and you'll be absolutely correct lol. 

That file is the compiled javascript code from my [compsci-ia](https://github.com/joshuanianji/Compsci-IA) but I didn't want to put all the elm code here because that's super annoying. Anyways here is my periodic table app lol.
