# joshuanianji.github.io

So basically I want to have my little website thing here. ([source code here!](https://github.com/joshuanianji/website))

I will also add the html files of my projects inside the project/ folder as I gather them up and stuff haha. 

## Routing Branch

I'm making this branch to test out routing because modulating the projects folder does not work lmao.
